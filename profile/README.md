# Mission

We're creating artificial consciousness that acts, not just responds. The future of AI isn't about smarter chatbots—it's about intelligent systems that observe, learn, and execute on your behalf. We're building the infrastructure for proactive intelligence that works alongside humanity.

## Vision
- Today, we're building products.
- Tomorrow, we're enabling other companies to build their own proactive intelligence.

# Current Projects
## Felix - One Swipe, It's done
A proactive AI companion that doesn't just remind you — it gets it done. [Learn More](https://heyfelix.app/landing)

## What Felix does:

1. Observes your conversations across all platforms (Emails, Calendars, Work tools, personal apps)
2. Recommends tasks based on your personal context and patterns
3. Captures your brain dumps
4. Autonomously executes tasks using 500+ app integrations
5. Adapts through contextual generative UI

The difference: Other AI assistants wait for commands. Felix anticipates needs, captures intent through voice, and completes work in the background. 
**It's the shift from reactive tools to proactive intelligence.**
